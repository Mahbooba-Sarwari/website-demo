        <h2>healthy diet</h2>
        <p> Healthy Food Guide makes it easy and enjoyable to eat well and feel great. Healthy eating means eating a wide variety of foods from each of the 5 major food groups, in the amounts recommended. Eating a variety of foods from the 5 major food groups provides a range of nutrients to the body, promotes good health and can help reduce the risk of disease - as well as keeping your diet interesting with different flavours and textures. Many of the foods that often feature regularly in modern diets do not form part of the 5 food groups. These foods, sometimes referred to as 'junk' foods, 'discretionary choices' or 'occasional foods' can be enjoyed sometimes, but should not feature regularly in a healthy diet.</p>
